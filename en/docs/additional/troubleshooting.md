# Troubleshooting

## I've created a host, but I can't find it in the hosts list

A newly created host will not automatically appear in the main host list. Instead, newly created hosts can be found in the host list under the `Not monitored` tab. This means that the host exists in openITCOCKPIT, but is not yet known to the monitoring engine.

You will first need to [export the configuration](../../monitoring/basic-principles/#how-do-i-carry-out-an-export) in order for the newly created host to be monitored.

## sudo_server

**Problem**

`sudo_server.service` is not running or the web interface has lost the connection.

Reload the web page.
If the problem still exists, restart the sudo_server service.

```
systemctl restart sudo_server.service
```

!!! tip
    tip For SQL query logging to take place, the option `'log' => true` must be set in the file `/opt/openitc/frontend/config/datasource.php`!

### Server information

## Where can I find the various log files?

### Naemon log

The log file for the Naemon monitoring engine can be found at

```
/opt/openitc/nagios/var/nagios.log
```

It is recommended to view the log file with the `oitc debug --tailf` command, as this replaces the Unix timestamps and UUIDs, which significantly increases the readability of the log file.

### openITCOCKPIT web frontend

```
/opt/openitc/logs/frontend/
```

### Gearman Job Server

```
/var/log/gearman-job-server/gearmand.log
```

### PHP-FPM

```
/var/log/php7.{0,1,2,3,4,...}-fpm.log
