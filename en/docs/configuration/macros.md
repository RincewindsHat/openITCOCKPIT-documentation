# Macros

Macros are variables that can be used in openITCOCKPIT, for example to store path information for check plugins or login data.

Macros always begin and end with a $ sign.

## Custom macros

Custom macros are by far the most commonly used type of macros in openITCOCKPIT. The name of the macro is always `USER` followed by a number, for example `$USER1$`

This macro type is often used to store path information, passwords and SNMP communities.

It is possible to hide values, e.g. to not make passwords directly visible. To do this, either select the "Hide value" option when creating or editing a macro or click on the button on the overview page.

!!! info
    Up to 256 user-defined macros can be saved.

## Contact macros

Contact macros can be stored with contacts to save login data for a ticketing system or other use cases.
The macros always follow the structure `$_CONTACT<macro-name>$`

## Host Macros

Host macros can be stored directly in a host template or with an individual host. These are usually used to store SNMP communities or other access data that is only relevant for one host.

The macros always follow the structure `$_HOST<macro-name>$`
  
Macros inherited from the host template are shown in green. Those coloured blue mean the macro was configured directly on the host. 

![Host Macros](/images/host-macros.png)

Host macros are available both when running the host check and when running service checks on the host.

## Service macros

Service macros can be stored directly in a service template or together with an individual service. This is usually used to store access data that is only relevant for one service.

The macros always follow the structure `$_SERVICE<macro-name>$`
  
Macros inherited from the service template are shown in green. Those coloured blue mean the macro was configured directly on the service.

Service macros are only available when running a service check.

## Default Macros

In addition to the macros that users can define themselves, the system also provides a number of default macros.
