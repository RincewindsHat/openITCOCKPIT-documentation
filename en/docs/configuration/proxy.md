# HTTP Proxy

To specify a proxy for use with openITCOCKPIT, navigate to `System Configuration -> System -> Proxy Settings` in the main menu.

There you can specify the proxy server using the port, IP address or host name.

Note that a proxy server can only be used if the `Enable Proxy` option has been enabled.
