# User administration

## Managing users

Users in openITCOCKPIT are managed here.

In the overview page, you will find a tabular list of all users available in openITCOCKPIT as well as the option to reset a user's password.

### Creating new users
To create a new user, click on the "New Local User" button.

In the form that appears, select the corresponding containers / container roles to which the user should have access.

Please note that individually assigned containers overwrite the permissions of container roles. This means that if a user has read and write permissions via a container role, these permissions can be changed using the individually selected container. This has the advantage that permissions for individual containers do not have to be defined in a completely new container role.

Now select a user role for the new user and set this to "Is active". If the "Is active" selection box is not set for a user, this user can no longer log into openITCOCKPIT.

In addition to the standard fields such as email address, first name, last name, company, position and telephone number, you have the option of setting standard parameters such as the date format, time zone and the language for the user interface. These can also be changed by the user via their profile settings.

You can also create API keys for the user here for use in API key authentication.

### Create new user (Active Directory / LDAP)

Essentially, creating a user via LDAP is similar to creating a local user. Just select "Import from LDAP" to add a new user via LDAP.

However, instead of entering the email address, first name and last name, the SAM account name is selected from a list. Email, first name and last name are then filled in automatically. A password is also not assigned here, as the new user logs in with their LDAP access data.

![reset password](/images/manageusers-resetpassword.png)

The user will receive an email with a new, randomly generated password which he can use to log onto the system.

## Managing user roles

User roles in openITCOCKPIT form the basis for user rights on and to the system. They determine what a user with a particular role may or may not do in openITCOCKPIT.

## Creating new user roles

To begin creating a new user role, click on the "New" button.

You can then assign a name and a description for the new user role.

Moving further down the form you can assign the corresponding rights for the new role. Rights can be assigned granularly for individual pages and actions or several can be assigned at the same time via the "Mass actions" button.

Using this method, all rights ("Index", "New", "Edit" or "Delete") can be assigned by clicking each one, individually, in turn for each page.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Name | :fontawesome-solid-times: | Name of the user role |
| Description |  | Description of the user role |

## User container roles

User container roles are collections of container permissions that can be applied for users in openITCOCKPIT.

A user container role can also be used to authorise users. A new user container role, however, must be created for this purpose.

### Creating user container roles

When creating a user container role, you must assign a name to the role and select the desired containers.
